      <p>
        after years of searching I finaly found my biological family in south
        America

      <img src="images/family2.jpg" width="700" height="700" />
      <p>
        it was a great exspirense learning about my roots and hearateg. I stayed
        there for a while but disided to go back home, though they are my
        biological family they were not my family. Over this jurny i must say
        the most importent thing i leard was not my biological family but was
        that family is more then just who you are related to.
