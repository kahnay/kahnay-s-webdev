      2 pounds orange fleshed sweet potatoes (about 3 large) 3 tablespoons extra

      Method Preheat oven and roasting pan: Preheat oven to 450째F. (For more
      crispiness, preheat your oven to 500째F.) Place a roasting pan or heavy
      duty baking sheet (one that can take high heat) in the oven to preheat.
      Peel and cut sweet potatoes into wedges: Peel the sweet potatoes and cut
      off the ends. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then, if they are
      very long, in half crosswise. Cut each piece into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick
      wedges. Alternately, you can slice the peeled sweet potato into disks
      either with a mandoline or a sharp knife. Sweet potatoes peeled and halved
      on a cutting board to make a sweet potato fry recipe. Sweet potato sliced
      into wedges to make homemade sweet potato fry recipe. Toss with oil, salt,
      spices: Put the sweet potatoes into a large bowl and add the oil. Mix well
      to combine. Sprinkle with salt and spices of your choice. Use your hands
      to mix well, so all pieces are coated with oil and spices. Tossing sweet
      potato wedges in seasoning in a glass bowl. Spread out onto preheated pan:
      Remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Carefully spread the
      sweet potatoes out in a single layer on the baking sheet. (Watch out, the
      pan is hot!) Sweet potato wedges seasoned on a baking sheet. Bake: Bake
      for 15 to 25 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet
      from the oven and use tongs to turn over all of the sweet potato pieces.
      Return to the oven and bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, or until they are
      well browned. Cooking time depends on the temperature of the oven (500째F
      will need less cooking time than 450째F) and the size and thinness of the
      sweet potato wedges. The browner they are, the crispier they will be, but
      there is a fine line between browned and burnt beyond edibility. Even if
      they get really dark, they should still be good because of the natural
      sugars of the sweet potatoes caramelizing. So watch carefully.
